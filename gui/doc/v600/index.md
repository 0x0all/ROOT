## GUI Libraries


### Attributes editors

-   The transparency sliders change the transparency only for the currently edited object.

### Object editing on canvas

-   The "move opaque" way to edit object on canvas, has been extended to all kind of
    objects.
-   When in move opaque mode, a canvas can show guide lines to place object relatively
    to each other. A new resource in `etc/system.rootrc` allows to turn the feature on
    or off: `Canvas.ShowGuideLines`.
